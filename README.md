# LearningOpenCV

Personal project for playing around with and learning OpenCV C++.


Prerequisites:

CUDA (https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html)

CUDNN (https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/install-guide/index.html)

OpenCV (https://github.com/opencv/opencv, https://docs.opencv.org/master/d7/d9f/tutorial_linux_install.html)




Note: Make sure to build OpenCV with CUDA and CUDNN support in order to use cuda backend in opencv.
